# Classification Project

### Predicting Horse Racing Results

For this project, we will set out to explore 
[Hong Kong syndecate horse racing data](https://www.kaggle.com/hrosebaby/horse-racing-dataset-for-experts-hong-kong?select=results.csv) 
to investigate predicting the probability of a horse's chance of placing (coming in first, second or third) in a race. Our data conists of results compiled from the 2014 and 2017 season of the Hong Kong Jockey Club.   

For this, we will look to use a logistic regression with our tagert being Placing (first/second/third position) or Not Placing. Our features will consist of the horse's stats, the jockey's stats, track information.
